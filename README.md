# System Monitoring Dashboard

Dashboard developed using Angular to monitor health, metrics, HTTP traces, etc. of this [simple employee management app](https://github.com/amycardoso/employee-manager-backend).
The operational information of the application is consumed through HTTP endpoints and is presented in a more visual way, through graphics and descriptive tables. It is also possible to download an xls file with the data of all HTTP requests.
The main objective in the development of this dashboard was to put into practice the knowledge acquired about the angular framework and learn to use the Chart.js library.

> The frotend + backend are hosted on heroku, so it may take a while for
> the application to load the first time.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
