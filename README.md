# System Monitoring Dashboard

Administration panel developed using Angular to monitor health, metrics, HTTP traces, etc. of [this simple spring application](https://github.com/amycardoso/employee-manager-backend). 
The information generated by the Spring Actuator is consumed and placed in a more visual way in this application, through graphs and descriptive tables. It is even possible to download a csv of the http request data.

The main objective of this project was to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the development of angular applications, as well as, to learn to use libraries such as Chart.js.

> The frotend + backend are hosted on heroku, so it may take a while for
> the application to load the first time.
