# System Monitoring Dashboard

Administration panel developed using Angular to monitor health, metrics, HTTP traces, etc. of [this simple spring application](https://github.com/amycardoso/employee-manager-backend). The main objective when developing this panel was to consume the information from the Actuator and learn to use new libraries, such as Chart.js.
